# eco-delivery

Creating an optimized routing system for delivery services requires consideration of several factors, including route optimization algorithms, emissions calculations, and cost assessment. Below is a simple Python program that outlines a basic routing optimization system. For the sake of simplicity, I'll use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between delivery points, but note that more complex algorithms (such as A* or vehicle routing problem solvers) might be needed for real-world applications.

This basic project does not take into account real-world constraints such as traffic, time windows, or vehicle capacity, but it serves as a foundation:

```python
import heapq

class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.edges = {}
    
    def add_edge(self, from_node, to_node, cost):
        if from_node not in self.edges:
            self.edges[from_node] = []
        self.edges[from_node].append((to_node, cost))

    def get_neighbors(self, node):
        return self.edges.get(node, [])
    
def dijkstra(graph, start, end):
    queue = [(0, start)]
    shortest_paths = {start: (None, 0)}
    
    while queue:
        (cost, node) = heapq.heappop(queue)

        for next_node, weight in graph.get_neighbors(node):
            current_cost = shortest_paths[node][1] + weight
            if next_node not in shortest_paths or current_cost < shortest_paths[next_node][1]:
                shortest_paths[next_node] = (node, current_cost)
                heapq.heappush(queue, (current_cost, next_node))
    
    path, total_cost = [], shortest_paths[end][1]
    while end is not None:
        path.append(end)
        end = shortest_paths[end][0]
    
    return path[::-1], total_cost if path[0] == start else None

def calculate_emissions_and_cost(distance, emission_factor=0.21, cost_per_km=0.5):
    """
    Function to calculate emissions and cost.
    Assumes:
    - emission_factor: the emissions produced per km in kg CO2
    - cost_per_km: the cost of delivery per km
    """
    emissions = distance * emission_factor
    cost = distance * cost_per_km
    return emissions, cost

def main():
    graph = Graph()
    
    # Sample graph edges with distances in kilometers:
    graph.add_edge('A', 'B', 5)
    graph.add_edge('A', 'C', 10)
    graph.add_edge('B', 'C', 3)
    graph.add_edge('B', 'D', 20)
    graph.add_edge('C', 'D', 2)
    graph.add_edge('C', 'E', 15)
    graph.add_edge('D', 'E', 1)

    try:
        start, end = 'A', 'E'
        path, total_distance = dijkstra(graph, start, end)
        
        if path:
            print(f"Optimized Path from {start} to {end}: {' -> '.join(path)}")
            print(f"Total Distance: {total_distance} km")
            
            emissions, cost = calculate_emissions_and_cost(total_distance)
            print(f"Estimated Emissions: {emissions:.2f} kg CO2")
            print(f"Estimated Cost: ${cost:.2f}")
        else:
            print(f"No path found from {start} to {end}")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Key Components:

1. **Graph Representation**: The graph represents nodes and edges to model delivery points and routes. We use a dictionary to store connections and costs.

2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph.

3. **Emissions and Cost Calculation**: A simple calculation function is provided that multiplies the total distance by assumed emission and cost factors per kilometer.

4. **Error Handling**: The program includes basic error handling, particularly around pathfinding logic and exceptional states during computation.

### Note:

This program simplifies many aspects of real-world delivery routing systems. Real scenarios would consider dynamic inputs, more complex constraints (time, traffic, vehicle capacity), and potentially integrate with APIs for live data (e.g., traffic updates).
